# VillageTech
Minecraft Mod: VillageTech is a WIP mod about making village structures functional, or at least upgradeable. Idea stems from brainstorming for LimpCraft2, but after JSON changes between 1.7.10 and 1.8, I took a step back and decided to restart. This is not so much a continuation of LimpCraft as it is a new mod all together. Yes, it will feature some of the old machines, but it won't rely on LimpCore and will be more well though out and stuff...
